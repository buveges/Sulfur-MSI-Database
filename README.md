# Sulfur-MSI-Database
Github repo of sulfur isotope database with interactive figures associated with Uveges et al., 2022.

The full database can be downloaded as a .xlsx file.

Interactive figures display the data from the database, and when clicking on a data point, will open up a new tab linking to a google scholar entry for the paper that sources that data point.
